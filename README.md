# Haiyun - Computational & Applied Mathematics

## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Haiyun

Iâ€™m a **Computational and Applied Mathematics Master's** student at **Friedrich-Alexander-UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg**. I specialize in **Modeling and Optimization**, and Iâ€™m passionate about **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, **Robotic Simulation** and **Numerical Methods**.

## ðŸ›  Skills & Tools

- **Languages**: Python, C++, SQL  
- **Tools**: Git, Linux, PyCharm, VS Code, Webots  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras, SciPy  
- **Techniques**: PDEs, Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite Difference Method (FDM), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL)

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### **Study Notes**
- [Study Notes](https://github.com/Haiyun314/Study_Notes): This repository contains comprehensive study notes and project materials covering key topics in robotics, control, reinforcement learning, and essential tech tools for modern development workflows.
- [A Hybrid Approach for Balancing a Two-Wheeled Humanoid Robot](https://github.com/Haiyun314/master_thesis)  
  This project presents a hybrid control framework aimed at achieving robust balance control for a two-wheeled humanoid robot. 

### **Visioncar-Ros2**
- [Visioncar-Ros2](https://github.com/Haiyun314/Visioncar-Ros2): A ROS 2-based simulation of a 4-wheeled car using a front camera to follow a visual path in Gazebo. Implements basic control strategies and sensor integration.

### **PINNs**  
- [PINN-2dNSEs](https://github.com/Haiyun314/PINN-2dNSEs): Built a **PINN model** using **TensorFlow** to solve time-dependent **Navier Stokes Equations**.  
- [Heat Equation](https://github.com/Haiyun314/intro-control-ml): Built a **PINN model** using **TensorFlow** to solve **Heat Equation**, also include FDM, Fourier method for comparison.  

### **Interesting**
- [Just-For-Fun](https://github.com/Haiyun314/Just_For_Fun): Hereâ€™s a collection of fun projectsâ€”some might be failed experiments, while some result in interesting creations. **Dynamic Mode Decomposition**, **Fourier method**, **RCNN** 
- [Mathematical Image Processing](https://github.com/Haiyun314/Image_processing): I worked on mathematical optimization for image processing tasks like segmentation and denoising. The results werenâ€™t as good as what CNNs can achieve, but the ideas were still pretty interesting!  

Feel free to check out my repositories and explore my work!
