# Haiyun - Computational & Applied Mathematics

## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Haiyun

Iâ€™m a **Computational and Applied Mathematics Master's** student at **Friedrich-Alexander-UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg**. I specialize in **Modeling and Optimization**, and Iâ€™m passionate about **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, **Robotic Simulation** and **Numerical Methods**.

## ðŸ›  Skills & Tools

- **Languages**: Python, C++, SQL  
- **Tools**: Git, Linux, PyCharm, VS Code, Webots  
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras, SciPy  
- **Techniques**: PDEs, Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite Difference Method (FDM), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL)

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

### **Just-For-Fun**
- Hereâ€™s a collection of fun projectsâ€”some might be failed experiments, while some result in interesting creations.
- [Just-For-Fun](https://github.com/Haiyun314/Just_For_Fun)

### **Image Processing**  
- I worked on mathematical optimization for image processing tasks like segmentation and denoising. The results werenâ€™t as good as what CNNs can achieve, but the ideas were still pretty interesting!

### **PINN Model for Navier Stokes Equations**  
- Built a **PINN model** using **TensorFlow** to solve time-dependent **Navier Stokes Equations**.  
- [PINN-2dNSEs](https://github.com/Haiyun314/PINN-2dNSEs)

### **PINN Model for Heat Equation**  
- Built a **PINN model** using **TensorFlow** to solve **Heat Equation**, also include FDM, Fourier method.

### **Non-Linear Optimization**  
- Applied optimization techniques to solve non-linear problems.  
- [NonLinear_Optimization](https://github.com/Haiyun314/NonLinear_Optimization)

### **Robotics**
- A starting point for simulating and controlling robots with Webots. Features a balance system and a car with a camera for vision tasks.
